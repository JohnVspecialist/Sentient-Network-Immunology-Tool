# SNIT is like a super-smart, biological security guard who learns and adapts. Itâ€™s modeled after the human immune system. It doesn't just follow a static rulebook; it gets better at its job every single day.

# What Makes It Special?
It Learns from Experience: Just like people, it learns from both its successes and its mistakes to improve.
It Has a Memory: It remembers every threat it's been taught about. The more it sees a threat, the stronger its memory becomes.
It Cleans Up After Itself: To stay efficient, it will eventually "forget" very old memories of threats it hasn't seen in a long time, just like our own immunity can fade for certain things.
It Checks Its Own Health: The system periodically reviews its own performance to see if it's making good decisions and suggests ways it can improve itself.

#In a Nutshell
SNIT is a security system that builds up an immunity to digital threats over time, making it an intelligent and evolving shield that gets stronger with every challenge it faces.

# The core innovation isn't the threat detection; it's the self-improvement engine (AdaptiveLearningEngine) and the immunological memory (ImmuneMemoryCell).

# The Core Mission, Distilled:
-Detect & Respond (The "Innate" System): Use a baseline set of detectors (for security, privacy, bias, etc.) to handle initial threats. This is the table stakes part of the system.
-Learn & Evolve (The "Adaptive" System): This is the crucial part. Every time the system responds to a threat, it gets feedback. Was the detection accurate? Was the response effective? This feedback strengthens or weakens a specific ImmuneMemoryCell.
-Optimize Autonomously (The "Intelligent" System): Over time, the system uses this learned memory to:
-Get Faster: Instantly recognize and neutralize threats it has seen before with higher confidence (get_evolved_detection_confidence).
-Get Smarter: Recommend and eventually automate more effective responses based on past outcomes (get_evolved_response_strategy).
-Self-Maintain: Recognize when its own performance is degrading and trigger self-healing or optimization cycles (SelfHealer, PerformanceOptimizer).
